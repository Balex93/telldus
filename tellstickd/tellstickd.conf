# The random interval times defines the allowed interval within the switch may take place 
# <off time>=22:15 and <on time random interval>=00:30 means that the actual switch will take

# Time format xx:yy where xx is hour and yy is minute
# If no turn on time or turn off time should be used. Note this with -1. See the example line below. Only to be used on turn on or turn off times.
