General
=================
This software is intended for controlling remote switch devices with rfcmd.

Dependencies
=================
For this script to run you need perl and the following perl-modules:
DateTime
DateTime::Event::Sunrise


Installation
=================
0. Install rfcmd and necessary perl modules (on a typical Fedora/Centos/RHEL with the necessary repos installed, this should do it for you: yum install perl-DateTime perl-DateTime-Event-Sunrise).

1. Copy the file tellstickd-version/tellstickd to /usr/local/bin/ (or anywhere else depending on your wishes).

2. Copy the file tellstickd-version/tellstickd.conf to /etc/ (or anywhere else depending on your wishes). 

3. Copy the suitable init script found under tellstickd-version/init_script to /etc/rc.d/init.d, this way you can control the script as any other service, easily make it start at boot (with chkconfig --level 35 tellstickd on). The file init_script/tellstickd is a Redhat type script whereas init_script/tellstickd.debian not unexpectedly should work on Debian type systems.
4. Remember to make the perl-script and init-script executable. As root chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/tellstickd /etc/rc.d/init.d/tellstickd

Configuration
=================
1. In tellstickd.conf:
	a. Set appropriate coordinates and timezone to suit your geographical location (further information: http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime-Event-Sunrise/lib/DateTime/Event/Sunrise.pm).
	b. Specifiy the rfcmd-binary location. Default: /usr/local/bin/rfcmd
	c. Specify the tellstick device name. Default: /dev/tellstick
	d. Specify the location of the logfile.
	e. Add device configurations. Multiple definitions for each device are possible (avoid having on and off times of multiple definitions overlapping each other).
   
2. If you would like this script to start at boot-time, on a RHEL/Centos/Fedora system, execute the following command chkconfig --level 35 tellstickd on
