General
=================
This software is intended for controlling remote switch devices with rfcmd.

Dependencies
=================
For this script to run you need perl and the following perl-modules:
DateTime
DateTime::Event::Sunrise


Installation
=================
0. Install rfcmd and necessary perl modules (on a typical Fedora/Centos/RHEL with the necessary repos installed, this should do it for you: yum install perl-DateTime perl-DateTime-Event-Sunrise).
1. Copy the file tellstickd-version/tellstickd to /usr/local/bin/
2. Copy the file tellstickd-version/tellstickd.conf to /etc/
3. If you have a Redhat-type system (like RHEL, Centos or Fedora), copy the script found under tellstickd-version/init_script to /etc/rc.d/init.d, this way you can control the script as any other service, easily make it start at boot (with chkconfig --level 35 tellstickd on).
4. Remember to make the perl-script and init script executable. As root chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/tellstickd /etc/rc.d/init.d/tellstickd

Configuration
=================
1. In the very top of the perl file /usr/local/bin/tellstickd:
	a. Set appropriate coordinates and timezone to suit your geographical location (further information: http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime-Event-Sunrise/lib/DateTime/Event/Sunrise.pm).
	b. Specifiy the rfcmd binary location. Default: /usr/local/bin/rfcmd
	c. Specify the tellstick device name. Default: /dev/tellstick
	d. If the default locations of the config and logfile not are according to your wishes, modify them here. Note 1: this can also be done with the tellstickd options --config and --logfile. Note 2: If you use the init script, these settings must be done in the init-script /etc/rc.d/init.d/tellstickd.
2. If you would like this script to start at boot-time, on a RHEL/Centos/Fedora system, execute the following command chkconfig --level 35 tellstickd on
